# search_engine

One day, I was having peaceful dinner with my husband at home.
We were happy untill we started talking about google search engine.

I asked my husband. 'How does quick answers in google works?'
My husband said, 'must be AI'.
I said,  'Well, that is pretty much what it is... but I'm sure we can do it without using AI. maybe we can split the sentence(search) and find website that contains this splited words?'
My huband said, 'No. I don't agree. it must be much complecated than that'.

Me : 'I know, I know... but in basic level, I guess I can make into work!'
Husband : 'I don't think so.'

We end up had argue and I have decided to make this project to proove it is working.

As a result, I realised this doesn't work. so he WIN.
However, I believe that if I have more data and filter them more, I will be able get correct response.

so this project is tbc......
